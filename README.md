# Rating Profiles
We aim to interpret and visualize users' behaviour on dating website LibimSeTi. Dataset provided by the company contains 250 MiBs of profiles with their ratings and is freely available.

We describe in detail how users give and receive ratings, what are assumptions to become popular, what are differences between males and females if it is possible to split the network into smaller communities. Further research concerns about user classification based on his or her features - gender, sexual orientation, rating weight, etc.

We write all the code in Python with the usage of graph libraries (e.g. NetworkX, GraphLab) and machine learning library Scikit-learn. We perform some of the graph embeddings in Gephi. And for large graph algorithms, we utilize Spark that might be helpful while processing all the data.
